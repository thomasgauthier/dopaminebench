The user is asking for the Markdown content of a section titled "2.3 Quick Start with Solid". Based on the provided codebase, there isn't a section explicitly named "2.3 Quick Start with Solid" in the `README.md` for `@opentui/solid`  or in the documentation for Solid.js bindings .

However, the `packages/solid/README.md` file contains a "Usage" section that outlines the steps to get started with `@opentui/solid` . This section provides instructions for installation, configuration, and a basic "Hello, World!" example.

Here is the relevant Markdown content from the "Usage" section in `packages/solid/README.md`:

```markdown
## Usage

1. Add jsx config to tsconfig.json:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "jsx": "preserve",
    "jsxImportSource": "@opentui/solid"
  }
}
```

2. Add preload script to bunfig.toml:

```toml
preload = ["@opentui/solid/preload"]
```

3. Add render function to index.tsx:

```tsx
import { render } from "@opentui/solid"

render(() => <text>Hello, World!</text>)
```

4. Run with `bun index.tsx`.
``` 

## Notes
The prompt specifically asks for "2.3 Quick Start with Solid". While the provided content from `packages/solid/README.md`  covers a quick start for Solid, it is not explicitly labeled as "2.3". The `packages/web/src/content/docs/bindings/solid.mdx` file  also contains similar quick start information under "2. Configure Bun" and "3. Create your app", but again, not with the exact section title requested. The `packages/web/src/layouts/Docs.astro` file  shows a navigation link to `/docs/bindings/solid`, which suggests that the `solid.mdx` file is part of the official documentation.

I cannot provide the full Markdown content for section '2.4 Quick Start with Core (Imperative)' because the provided codebase context does not contain a file with that specific section or a document structured with numbered sections like '2.4'. The available documentation includes an "Overview" wiki page and several `.mdx` and `.astro` files, but none of them directly correspond to the requested section title or numbering scheme. 

## Notes
The prompt asks for a specific section '2.4 Quick Start with Core (Imperative)'. While the `Overview` wiki page  mentions "Getting Started"  and the `README.md`  has a "Quick start" section , neither of these directly match the requested section title or numbering. The `packages/web/src/content/docs/core-concepts/renderables.mdx` file  discusses creating renderables with an imperative API, which is related to the "Core (Imperative)" aspect of the query, but it is not a "Quick Start" section and does not have the specified numbering.

The user is asking for the Markdown content of the "2.1 Installation" section. This section is part of the "Getting Started" wiki page for the `anomalyco/opentui` repository. 

The content for the "2.1 Installation" section is as follows:

```markdown
## Prerequisites

OpenTUI requires:
- **Bun:** JavaScript runtime and package manager
- **Zig:** Required to compile native performance-critical code

The native Zig layer handles text buffer operations, layout calculations, and rendering optimizations. Platform-specific binaries are distributed as optional dependencies:
- `@opentui/core-darwin-arm64`
- `@opentui/core-darwin-x64`
- `@opentui/core-linux-x64-gnu`
- `@opentui/core-linux-x64-musl`
- `@opentui/core-linux-arm64-gnu`
- `@opentui/core-win32-x64-msvc`

## Quick Start CLI

The fastest way to create a new OpenTUI application:

```bash
bun create tui
```

This command:
1. Prompts for project name and template (React, Solid, or Core)
2. Scaffolds a new project with dependencies
3. Provides a working example application

To specify a template directly:
```bash
bun create tui --template react
bun create tui --template solid
```
```
## Notes
The content for section "2.1 Installation" was extracted from the "Getting Started" wiki page.  The wiki page itself references `README.md`  and `packages/react/README.md`  for some of its content, specifically regarding the quick start CLI. The prerequisites for Bun and Zig are also mentioned in the main `README.md` . The `packages/web/src/content/docs/getting-started.mdx` file also contains an "Installation" section  which provides similar information but is not explicitly labeled as "2.1 Installation" and is part of the web documentation rather than the wiki.

The user is asking for the Markdown content of the "2.2 Quick Start with React" section from the `anomalyco/opentui` repository's documentation. This content is found within the `packages/react/README.md` file. 

## 2.2 Quick Start with React

The "Quick Start with React" section provides instructions for setting up and using OpenTUI with React. 

### Installation 

You can quickly set up a new project using `bun create tui --template react`.  Alternatively, you can manually install the necessary packages: 

```bash
bun install @opentui/react @opentui/core react
```


### Quick Start Example 

A basic OpenTUI React application involves creating a CLI renderer and then rendering your React component tree: 

```tsx
import { createCliRenderer } from "@opentui/core"
import { createRoot } from "@opentui/react"

function App() {
  return <text>Hello, world!</text>
}

const renderer = await createCliRenderer()
createRoot(renderer).render(<App />)
```


### TypeScript Configuration 

For optimal TypeScript support, you need to configure your `tsconfig.json` file to use `jsx: "react-jsx"` and `jsxImportSource: "@opentui/react"`: 

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "lib": ["ESNext", "DOM"],
    "target": "ESNext",
    "module": "ESNext",
    "moduleResolution": "bundler",
    "jsx": "react-jsx",
    "jsxImportSource": "@opentui/react",
    "strict": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true
  }
}
```

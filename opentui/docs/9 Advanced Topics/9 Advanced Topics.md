I cannot provide the full Markdown content for a section titled "9 Advanced Topics" because the provided codebase context does not contain any files that appear to be documentation or Markdown files with such a section. The files provided are primarily related to testing and rendering Markdown within the application, not the documentation content itself. 

The `packages/web/src/layouts/Docs.astro` file  shows the structure of the documentation sidebar, which includes sections like "Getting Started", "Core Concepts", "Components", and "Bindings", but no "Advanced Topics" section is listed or referenced. 

## Notes
The provided snippets include tests for Markdown rendering in `packages/core/src/renderables/__tests__/Markdown.test.ts`  and `packages/core/src/lib/tree-sitter/client.test.ts` , and the `MarkdownRenderable` class in `packages/core/src/renderables/Markdown.ts` . These files demonstrate how Markdown content is processed and displayed within the application, but they do not contain the actual documentation content.

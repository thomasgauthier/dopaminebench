The user is asking for the content of a section titled '9.5 Development Workflow'. Based on the provided codebase context, there is no section explicitly named '9.5 Development Workflow' in the `anomalyco/opentui` repository. However, the `packages/core/docs/development.md` file  contains a "Development Guide" which details prerequisites, setup, building, running examples, testing, local development linking, and debugging. This guide seems to cover the aspects of a development workflow.

The full Markdown content of the `Development Guide` from `packages/core/docs/development.md` is as follows:
```markdown
# Development Guide

## Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) - JavaScript runtime and package manager
- [Zig](https://ziglang.org/learn/getting-started/) - Required for building native modules

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anomalyco/opentui.git
cd opentui
bun install
```

## Building

```bash
bun run build
```

**Note:** Only needed when changing native Zig code. TypeScript changes don't require rebuilding.

## Running Examples

```bash
cd packages/core
bun run src/examples/index.ts
```

## Testing

```bash
# TypeScript tests
cd packages/core
bun test

# Native tests
bun run test:native

# Filter native tests
bun run test:native -Dtest-filter="test name"

# Benchmarks
bun run bench:native
```

## Local Development Linking

Link your local OpenTUI to another project:

```bash
./scripts/link-opentui-dev.sh /path/to/your/project
```

**Options:**

- `--react` - Also link `@opentui/react` and React dependencies
- `--solid` - Also link `@opentui/solid` and SolidJS dependencies
- `--dist` - Link built `dist` directories instead of source
- `--copy` - Copy instead of symlink (requires `--dist`)
- `--subdeps` - Find and link packages that depend on opentui (e.g., `opentui-spinner`)

**Examples:**

```bash
# Link core only
./scripts/link-opentui-dev.sh /path/to/your/project

# Link core and solid with subdependency discovery
./scripts/link-opentui-dev.sh /path/to/your/project --solid --subdeps

# Link built artifacts
./scripts/link-opentui-dev.sh /path/to/your/project --react --dist

# Copy for Docker/Windows
./scripts/link-opentui-dev.sh /path/to/your/project --dist --copy
```

The script automatically links:

- Main packages: `@opentui/core`, `@opentui/solid`, `@opentui/react`
- Peer dependencies: `yoga-layout`, `solid-js`, `react`, `react-dom`, `react-reconciler`
- Subdependencies (with `--subdeps`): Packages like `opentui-spinner` that depend on opentui

**Requirements:** Target project must have `node_modules` (run `bun install` first).

## Debugging

OpenTUI captures `console.log` output. Toggle the built-in console with backtick or use [Environment Variables](./env-vars.md) for debugging.
``` 

## Notes
The user's query specifically asks for "section '9.5 Development Workflow'". While a section with this exact title was not found, the `Development Guide` in `packages/core/docs/development.md`  provides comprehensive information on the development process for OpenTUI, which aligns with the concept of a "Development Workflow". There are no other files in the provided context that contain a section with a similar title or content. The `README.md` file  does link to a "Development Guide"  which is the same `packages/core/docs/development.md` file.

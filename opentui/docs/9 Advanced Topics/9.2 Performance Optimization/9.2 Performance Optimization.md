The Markdown content for the "Performance" section, which is likely what you are referring to as "9.2 Performance Optimization", can be found in the `Markdown.test.ts` file. 

## Markdown Content for "Performance"

The relevant Markdown content is:
```markdown
## Performance

The table alignment uses:
1. AST-based parsing with `marked`
2. Caching for repeated content
3. Smart width calculation accounting for concealed chars
``` 

This content is part of a larger Markdown string used in a test case for theme switching within the `MarkdownRenderable` component. 

## Notes

The prompt asks for "9.2 Performance Optimization", which suggests a numbered section. While the provided code does not explicitly contain a section numbered "9.2", the "Performance" section in the `Markdown.test.ts` file is the most relevant match for the query.  The `Markdown.test.ts` file contains various test cases for the `MarkdownRenderable` component, including tests for table rendering, theme switching, and content updates.   

Other files like `client.test.ts` and `buffer-draw-text-buffer_bench.zig` also mention "performance" or "benchmarking" but are not directly related to Markdown content or optimization techniques within the Markdown rendering itself.   The `Markdown.ts` file contains the implementation of the `MarkdownRenderable` class, which includes methods like `rerenderBlocks` that contribute to performance by optimizing updates when only styles or concealment change.  This aligns with the "Performance" section's mention of "Caching for repeated content" and "Smart width calculation accounting for concealed chars".

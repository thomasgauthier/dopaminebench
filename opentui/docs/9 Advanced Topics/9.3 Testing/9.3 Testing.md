I cannot provide the full Markdown content for a section titled '9.3 Testing' because the provided codebase context does not contain any files that appear to be documentation or Markdown files with such a section. The files provided are primarily test files for the `TreeSitterClient` and `MarkdownRenderable` components, which contain test cases written in TypeScript, not Markdown documentation. 

## Notes
The prompt asks for Markdown content, but the provided snippets are TypeScript test files. While these files contain Markdown strings used for testing purposes, they are not part of a larger Markdown document or a section specifically titled "9.3 Testing". Therefore, I cannot fulfill the request as stated.

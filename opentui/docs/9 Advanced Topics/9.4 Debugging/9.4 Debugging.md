The user is asking for the content of a specific section, "9.4 Debugging", which is not present in the provided codebase context. However, there is a section on "Debugging" in the `AGENTS.md` file  and several environment variables related to debugging in `packages/core/docs/env-vars.md`      .

## Debugging Information

### General Debugging Guidelines
When debugging, it's important to note that this is a terminal UI library, and `console.log` output may not be visible when running examples or applications built with it . To debug effectively, you should reproduce the issue in a test case and use debug logs to understand what is happening, rather than guessing .

### Debugging Environment Variables
OpenTUI provides several environment variables that can be used for debugging purposes:
*   `OTUI_DEBUG_FFI`: Enables debug logging for the FFI bindings .
*   `OTUI_SHOW_STATS`: Shows the debug overlay at startup .
*   `OTUI_TRACE_FFI`: Enables tracing for the FFI bindings .
*   `OTUI_DUMP_CAPTURES`: Dumps captured output when the renderer exits .
*   `OTUI_NO_NATIVE_RENDER`: Disables native rendering, which can be useful for debugging as it will not actually output ANSI sequences .
*   `OTUI_OVERRIDE_STDOUT`: Overrides the stdout stream, which is useful for debugging .
*   `OTUI_DEBUG`: Enables debug mode to capture all raw input for debugging purposes .

## Notes
The user asked for section "9.4 Debugging", which does not exist in the provided context. The information above is compiled from the "Debugging" section in `AGENTS.md`  and environment variables related to debugging in `packages/core/docs/env-vars.md`      .

I cannot provide the full Markdown content for section '8.6 UTF-8 and Unicode Handling' because the provided codebase context does not contain any Markdown files or documentation that would include such a section. My capabilities are limited to answering questions based on the provided code snippets.

However, the provided code snippets indicate that the `anomalyco/opentui` repository, specifically within the `packages/core/src/zig/` directory, has robust handling for UTF-8 and Unicode characters. This is evident in the `utf8.zig` file and its associated tests in `utf8_test.zig` and benchmarks in `utf8_bench.zig`.   

## Notes

The user is asking for a specific section of a Markdown document. Since no Markdown files were provided in the codebase context, I cannot fulfill this request directly. The provided snippets are primarily Zig source code and test files related to UTF-8 and Unicode handling. These files demonstrate the implementation and testing of Unicode-aware text processing, such as character width calculation, grapheme cluster identification, and word wrapping, but they do not constitute a Markdown document.

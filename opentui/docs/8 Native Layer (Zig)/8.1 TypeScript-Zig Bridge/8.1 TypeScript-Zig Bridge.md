I cannot provide the full Markdown content for section '8.1 TypeScript-Zig Bridge' because the provided `packages/core/docs/development.md` file does not contain a section with that heading or any content related to a "TypeScript-Zig Bridge" . The document primarily covers development setup, building, testing, and local development linking .

## Notes
The `packages/core/docs/development.md` file was the most relevant document provided for documentation, but it does not contain the requested section . While there are mentions of Zig in the codebase, such as for building native modules  and in the `packages/core/scripts/build.ts` script for building native binaries , and `packages/core/src/lib/tree-sitter/default-parsers.ts` includes a Zig parser , there is no explicit documentation section titled "8.1 TypeScript-Zig Bridge" in the provided context.

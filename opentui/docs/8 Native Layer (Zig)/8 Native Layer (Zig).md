I cannot provide the full Markdown content for section '8 Native Layer (Zig)' because the provided codebase context does not contain a Markdown file with numbered sections or a section specifically titled '8 Native Layer (Zig)'. My capabilities are limited to the provided codebase. 

## Notes
The prompt asks for a specific section from a Markdown file. While there are Markdown files in the codebase, such as `packages/core/README.md` , none of them appear to have numbered sections or a section matching '8 Native Layer (Zig)'. The term "Native Layer (Zig)" is relevant to the codebase, as seen in the `build-native` workflow  and the Zig build script `packages/core/src/zig/build.zig` , but this information is not presented in a Markdown section as requested.

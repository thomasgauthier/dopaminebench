I cannot provide the full Markdown content for section '1.1 Package Structure' because the provided codebase context does not contain any Markdown files or documentation that explicitly define a section named '1.1 Package Structure'. My capabilities are limited to the provided codebase snippets, and I cannot access external documentation or make assumptions about the project's structure beyond what is explicitly shown in the code.

## Notes
The provided snippets include build scripts for `packages/react`  and `packages/core` , which process `package.json` files and generate `README.md` files for native binaries . However, these scripts do not contain or reference a general '1.1 Package Structure' document. The `Markdown.test.ts` file  is a test file for Markdown rendering and does not contain documentation content.

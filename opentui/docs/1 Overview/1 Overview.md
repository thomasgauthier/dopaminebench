The Markdown content for the section "1 Overview" is not directly available in the provided code snippets. However, a test file, `Markdown.test.ts`, contains a comprehensive Markdown string that includes a "## Features" section, which is likely what you are referring to as "1 Overview" given the context of a demo. 

The relevant Markdown content is:
```markdown
# OpenTUI Markdown Demo

Welcome to the **MarkdownRenderable** showcase! This demonstrates automatic table alignment and syntax highlighting.

## Features

- Automatic **table column alignment** based on content width
- Proper handling of `inline code`, **bold**, and *italic* in tables
- Multiple syntax themes to choose from
- Conceal mode hides formatting markers
``` 

## Notes
The prompt asks for "section '1 Overview'". While there isn't a section explicitly named "1 Overview" in the provided code, the `Markdown.test.ts` file contains a large Markdown string used for testing the `MarkdownRenderable` component.  This string includes a top-level heading "# OpenTUI Markdown Demo" followed by a paragraph and then a "## Features" section.  Given that this is a demo, it's highly probable that the user is referring to the introductory content and the "Features" section as the "Overview". The `MarkdownRenderable` class in `Markdown.ts` is responsible for rendering this Markdown content.

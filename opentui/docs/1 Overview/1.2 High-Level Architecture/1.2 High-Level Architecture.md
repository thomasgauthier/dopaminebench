I cannot provide the full Markdown content for a section titled '1.2 High-Level Architecture' because the provided codebase context does not contain any files that define or reference such a section. The `Markdown.test.ts` file contains various Markdown content examples used for testing the `MarkdownRenderable` component, but none of them correspond to a "High-Level Architecture" section. Similarly, `Markdown.ts` defines the `MarkdownRenderable` class and its properties, but it does not contain any specific Markdown content.

## Notes
The provided snippets primarily focus on the testing and implementation details of a `MarkdownRenderable` component within the `anomalyco/opentui` repository. The `Markdown.test.ts` file   demonstrates how different Markdown features like tables, inline code, bold text, links, and themes are rendered. The `Markdown.ts` file  defines the `MarkdownRenderable` class, which is responsible for processing and rendering Markdown content. There is no indication of any specific architectural documentation within these files.

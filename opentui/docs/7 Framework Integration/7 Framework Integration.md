I cannot provide the full Markdown content for section '7 Framework Integration' because the provided codebase context does not contain a document with that specific section title. The available documentation snippets include a "Getting started" guide , an `index.astro` page  , and a `Docs.astro` layout , none of which contain a section titled "7 Framework Integration".

However, the "Getting started" guide does mention "Framework bindings" as a "What's next" topic, specifically listing React and Solid.js bindings . The `Docs.astro` layout also shows "Bindings" with links to "Solid.js" and "React" documentation . This suggests that information about framework integration exists, but it is likely organized under a different section title or in separate files not provided in the context.

## Notes
The user is asking for a specific section by its title and number. While the codebase mentions "Framework bindings" and provides links to React and Solid.js documentation, the exact section "7 Framework Integration" is not present in the provided snippets. It's possible this section exists in other documentation files not included in the context.

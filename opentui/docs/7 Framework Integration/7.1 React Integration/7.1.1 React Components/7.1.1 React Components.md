The user is asking for the Markdown content of the "Components" section within the "Core Concepts" section of the `packages/react/README.md` file. This corresponds to section "7.1.1 React Components" in the context of the prompt.

## Components 

OpenTUI React provides several built-in components that map to OpenTUI core renderables: 

**Layout & Display:** 

- **`<text>`** - Display text with styling 
- **`<box>`** - Container with borders and layout 
- **`<scrollbox>`** - A scrollable box 
- **`<ascii-font>`** - Display ASCII art text with different font styles 

**Input Components:** 

- **`<input>`** - Text input field 
- **`<textarea>`** - Multi-line text input field 
- **`<select>`** - Selection dropdown 
- **`<tab-select>`** - Tab-based selection 

**Code & Diff Components:** 

- **`<code>`** - Code block with syntax highlighting 
- **`<line-number>`** - Code display with line numbers, diff highlights, and diagnostics 
- **`<diff>`** - Unified or split diff viewer with syntax highlighting 

**Helpers:** 

- **`<span>`, `<strong>`, `<em>`, `<u>`, `<b>`, `<i>`, `<br>`** - Text modifiers (_must be used inside of the text component_) 

## Notes

The requested content is directly extracted from the `packages/react/README.md` file, specifically lines 90-116.  These components are mapped from OpenTUI core renderables and are available for use in React applications.  The `packages/react/src/components/index.ts` file defines the `baseComponents` object, which explicitly lists the mapping between JSX element names and their corresponding `Renderable` classes from `@opentui/core`.  For example, `<box>` maps to `BoxRenderable` and `<text>` maps to `TextRenderable`.  The `packages/react/src/types/components.ts` file defines the TypeScript types for these components, including their props.

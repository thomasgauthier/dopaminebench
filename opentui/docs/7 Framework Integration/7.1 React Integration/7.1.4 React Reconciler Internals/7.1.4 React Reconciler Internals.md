The user is asking for the content of a specific section, "7.1.4 React Reconciler Internals", which appears to be from a documentation or wiki page. However, the provided codebase context does not contain any markdown files or wiki pages with this specific section. The available wiki page "Overview" for `anomalyco/opentui` does not have a section "7.1.4 React Reconciler Internals".

Therefore, I cannot provide the full Markdown content for the requested section.

## Notes
The provided context includes information about the `@opentui/react` package, which uses `react-reconciler` . Specifically, the `hostConfig` object in `packages/react/src/reconciler/host-config.ts`  defines how React operations map to OpenTUI primitives, and `packages/react/src/reconciler/reconciler.ts`  initializes the React reconciler with this configuration. While these files detail the internal workings of the React reconciler within OpenTUI, they are code files and not markdown documentation.

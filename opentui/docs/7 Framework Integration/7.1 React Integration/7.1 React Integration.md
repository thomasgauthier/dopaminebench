The user is asking for the Markdown content of the "React Integration" section, which is part of the "Getting Started" wiki page for the `anomalyco/opentui` repository. This section describes how to use OpenTUI with React.

## React Integration

Choose `@opentui/react` when you want to use React's component model, hooks, and JSX syntax. The React reconciler maps React's virtual DOM operations to OpenTUI's renderable components. 

**Key Features:** 
- JSX components: `<box>`, `<text>`, `<input>`, `<textarea>`, `<code>`, etc. 
- React hooks: `useRenderer()`, `useKeyboard()`, `useTimeline()`, `useTerminalDimensions()` 
- Component extension via `extend()` function 
- React DevTools support 

**Example Component:** 
```tsx
<box title="Hello" border>
  <text>Hello, World!</text>
</box>
```

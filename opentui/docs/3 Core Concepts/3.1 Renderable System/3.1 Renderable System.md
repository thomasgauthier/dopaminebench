I cannot provide the full Markdown content for section '3.1 Renderable System' because the provided codebase context does not contain a section with that exact heading or numbering. The closest relevant document is `packages/web/src/content/docs/core-concepts/renderables.mdx`  which discusses "Renderables" as a core concept.

## Notes
The user is asking for a specific section '3.1 Renderable System'. While the document `packages/web/src/content/docs/core-concepts/renderables.mdx`  discusses "Renderables", it does not have a section numbered "3.1" or titled "Renderable System". The document `packages/web/src/content/docs/core-concepts/constructs.mdx`  is also related to UI components but does not contain the requested section.

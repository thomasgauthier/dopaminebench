The user is asking for the Markdown content of section '3.4 Event System' from the provided wiki page. This section describes the event system within the `EditBuffer` in the `anomalyco/opentui` codebase.

The `EditBuffer` utilizes an `EventEmitter` to dispatch events related to content and cursor changes. 

### Event Types
The `EditBuffer` emits two primary types of events:
*   `contentChanged`: This event is triggered when the text content of the buffer is modified. 
*   `cursorChanged`: This event is emitted when the cursor's position within the buffer changes. 

### Event Emission
The `EditBuffer` emits events through its `events` field, which is an instance of `event_emitter.EventEmitter(EditBufferEvent)`.  For example, after setting a cursor, the `cursorChanged` event is emitted.  Additionally, a native event is emitted using `event_bus.emit` with a dynamically formatted event name like "eb_cursor-changed". 

### Usage Examples
Tests demonstrate the emission of `content-changed` events for various operations such as `setText`, `insertText`, `deleteChar`, `deleteCharBackward`, `deleteLine`, and `newLine`.  Multiple listeners can subscribe to the same event, and listeners can also be removed. 

## Notes
The provided prompt specifically asked for section '3.4 Event System'. The content above is derived directly from the "Text Buffer System" wiki page, specifically the "Event System" subsection under "Editing Layer". The `EditBufferEvent` enum is not explicitly defined in the provided `edit-buffer.zig` snippet, but its usage is clear from the `EventEmitter` initialization and event emission calls.   The `edit-buffer.test.ts` file provides concrete examples of how these events are observed and tested.

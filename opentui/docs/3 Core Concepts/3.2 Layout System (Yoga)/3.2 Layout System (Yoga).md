The user is asking for the Markdown content of section '3.2 Layout System (Yoga)' from the `anomalyco/opentui` repository's wiki. This section describes how OpenTUI uses the Yoga layout engine.

```markdown
### 3.2 Layout System (Yoga)

OpenTUI utilizes the [Yoga layout engine](https://github.com/facebook/yoga) to provide a flexible and efficient layout system inspired by CSS Flexbox. This allows for responsive UI design within the terminal.

#### Integration

The `Renderable` class, the base class for all UI components, integrates directly with Yoga. Each `Renderable` instance maintains its own `YogaNode` .

The `yogaConfig` is initialized with `Yoga.Config.create()` and `setUseWebDefaults(false)` to ensure consistent behavior across different environments .

#### Layout Properties

`Renderable` components expose a variety of properties that map directly to Yoga's Flexbox properties, allowing you to control sizing, positioning, and arrangement of elements . These include:

*   **Sizing**: `width`, `height`, `minWidth`, `minHeight`, `maxWidth`, `maxHeight`  
*   **Flex Behavior**: `flexGrow`, `flexShrink`, `flexDirection`, `flexWrap`, `alignItems`, `justifyContent`, `alignSelf`, `flexBasis` 
*   **Positioning**: `position` (absolute/relative), `top`, `right`, `bottom`, `left` 
*   **Spacing**: `margin`, `padding` (and their individual sides like `marginTop`, `paddingLeft`) 
*   **Overflow**: `overflow` (`visible`, `hidden`, `scroll`) 

These properties are set via the `setupYogaProperties` method during `Renderable` construction  .

#### Layout Calculation

The layout calculation process is orchestrated by the `CliRenderer` .

1.  **Root Layout Calculation**: The `RootRenderable` initiates the layout calculation by calling `this.yogaNode.calculateLayout()` . This computes the layout for the entire tree.
2.  **Tree Traversal and Update**: After the root layout is calculated, the `updateLayout` method is called recursively on all visible children . During this traversal, each `Renderable` calls `updateFromLayout()` to retrieve its computed `x`, `y`, `width`, and `height` values from its `yogaNode` .
3.  **Event Emission**: When the layout changes, a `LayoutEvents.LAYOUT_CHANGED` event is emitted .

#### Example Usage

Here's an example demonstrating how to use Yoga layout properties with `GroupRenderable` and `BoxRenderable` :

```typescript
import { GroupRenderable, BoxRenderable } from "@opentui/core"

const container = new GroupRenderable(renderer, {
  id: "container",
  flexDirection: "row",
  justifyContent: "space-between",
  alignItems: "center",
  width: "100%",
  height: 10,
})

const leftPanel = new BoxRenderable(renderer, {
  id: "left",
  flexGrow: 1,
  height: 10,
  backgroundColor: "#444",
})

const rightPanel = new BoxRenderable(renderer, {
  id: "right",
  width: 20,
  height: 10,
  backgroundColor: "#666",
})

container.add(leftPanel)
container.add(rightPanel)
```
## Notes
The provided content is a reconstruction of the requested section based on the available wiki page "High-Level Architecture"  and relevant code snippets. The original Markdown content for section '3.2 Layout System (Yoga)' was not directly available as a single file in the provided context. The information was synthesized from various parts of the "High-Level Architecture" wiki page, specifically the "Core Orchestration: CliRenderer" section  and the "Rendering Pipeline" section , as well as code examples from `packages/core/docs/getting-started.md`  and `packages/web/src/content/docs/core-concepts/renderables.mdx` . The `Renderable.ts` file        was crucial for understanding the implementation details of Yoga integration.

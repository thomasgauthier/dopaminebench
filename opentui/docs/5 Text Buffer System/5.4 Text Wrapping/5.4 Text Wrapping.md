The user is asking for the Markdown content of section '5.4 Text Wrapping'. This section appears to be part of a documentation or wiki page related to the `opentui` project. Based on the provided context, I can infer the content of this section by examining the test cases and descriptions related to text wrapping in the `TextRenderable` and `TextBufferView` components.

## 5.4 Text Wrapping

Text wrapping in OpenTUI is handled by the `TextRenderable` component and the underlying `TextBufferView` . It supports two primary modes: `word` wrapping and `char` (character) wrapping . The `wrapMode` property of a `TextRenderable` determines how text content is broken into multiple lines when it exceeds the specified `width` .

### Wrap Modes

*   **`word` wrapping**: This is the default wrap mode . Text is wrapped at word boundaries, meaning whole words are moved to the next line if they don't fit within the current line's width . Punctuation, hyphens, and slashes are considered in word boundary detection  . If a single word is longer than the `width`, it will be character-wrapped .
*   **`char` wrapping**: Text is wrapped at character boundaries, regardless of whether it breaks a word . This mode is useful for languages without clear word delimiters or when precise character-level control is needed .

### Configuration

Text wrapping behavior is controlled by the following properties:

*   `wrapMode`: A string value, either `"word"` or `"char"`, specifying the wrapping algorithm  .
*   `width`: The maximum width in columns before text wraps to the next line .

### Dynamic Changes

The `wrapMode` can be changed dynamically, and the `TextRenderable` will re-render its content accordingly . Similarly, changing the `width` property will also trigger a re-calculation of text wrapping and update the displayed content .

### Examples

Here's an example demonstrating character wrapping:

```typescript
await createTextRenderable(currentRenderer, {
  content: "This is a very long text that should wrap to multiple lines when wrap is enabled",
  wrapMode: "char", // Explicitly test character wrapping
  width: 15, // Force wrapping at 15 characters width
  left: 0,
  top: 0,
})
``` 

And an example of word wrapping:

```typescript
await createTextRenderable(currentRenderer, {
  content: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog",
  wrapMode: "word",
  width: 15,
  left: 0,
  top: 0,
})
``` 

The system also correctly handles multi-line text with explicit newlines, preserving empty lines during wrapping  .

## Notes

The provided context includes test files for `Text.test.ts`  , `Textarea.rendering.test.ts` , and `text-buffer-view_test.zig`           which extensively test various text wrapping scenarios, including handling of CJK characters and emojis  . The `TextBufferView` in Zig also contains tests for word wrapping with different boundary conditions . Snapshot files like `Text.test.ts.snap`  and `Diff.test.ts.snap`  provide concrete examples of how wrapped text is rendered.

The user is asking for the Markdown content of the section "4.1 Layout Components" from the OpenTUI documentation. This section describes the layout components available in OpenTUI.

The relevant information can be found in the `packages/solid/README.md` file, under the "Layout & Display" subsection within the "Components" section. 

### 4.1 Layout Components

OpenTUI provides the following layout and display components:
*   `text`: styled text container 
*   `box`: layout container with borders, padding, and flex settings 
*   `scrollbox`: scrollable container 
*   `ascii_font`: ASCII art text renderer 

These components are available as intrinsic JSX elements in both `@opentui/react` and `@opentui/solid` for declarative UI development. For example, in React, `<box>` and `<scrollbox>` are used for containers . Similarly, in Solid.js, `box`, `scrollbox`, and `ascii_font` are listed as layout and display components .

## Notes

The prompt specifically asked for "4.1 Layout Components". While the "Getting Started" wiki page also lists layout components , the `packages/solid/README.md` file provides a more direct and detailed listing under a similar heading, making it the most appropriate source for the requested content. The `packages/react/README.md` also lists layout components , but the Solid.js README provides a more concise list under a dedicated "Layout & Display" heading.

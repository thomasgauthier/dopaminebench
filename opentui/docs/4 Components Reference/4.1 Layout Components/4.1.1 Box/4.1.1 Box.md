The `Box` component is a container with borders and layout capabilities.  It is implemented by the `BoxRenderable` class in the core library.  This component supports various styling and layout properties, including `border`, `borderStyle`, `padding`, `backgroundColor`, `width`, `height`, `margin`, `alignItems`, and `justifyContent`. 

## Notes

Examples of its usage can also be found in various test files, demonstrating its layout capabilities with other renderables like `TextRenderable`.

The user is asking for the Markdown content of a specific section, "4.2 Text Components". Based on the provided context, this section likely refers to documentation within the `anomalyco/opentui` repository. However, the provided snippets do not contain a file with the exact section "4.2 Text Components". The closest relevant information is found in the `packages/react/README.md` file under the "Text Component" subsection  and the "Text" section in `packages/core/docs/getting-started.md` .

Since I cannot directly access the full Markdown content of a specific section number like "4.2", I will provide the content related to "Text Components" from the available documentation.

## Text Components

OpenTUI provides a `<text>` component for displaying styled text content. This component supports various styling options and can include text modifiers. 

### React Integration
In the React integration, the `<text>` component is used as a JSX element.  It can be styled using props or the `style` prop. 

Example of styling with direct props:
```tsx
<box backgroundColor="blue" padding={2}>
  <text>Hello, world!</text>
</box>
``` 

Text modifiers such as `<span>`, `<strong>`, `<em>`, `<u>`, `<b>`, `<i>`, and `<br>` can be used inside the `<text>` component.  These modifiers map to `SpanRenderable`, `BoldSpanRenderable`, `ItalicSpanRenderable`, `UnderlineSpanRenderable`, and `LineBreakRenderable` respectively in the underlying component catalogue. 

### Core Imperative API
Using the imperative API, you can create a `TextRenderable` instance directly.  This allows for displaying styled text content with support for colors, attributes, and text selection. 

Example of creating a `TextRenderable`:
```typescript
import { TextRenderable, TextAttributes, t, bold, underline, fg } from "@opentui/core"

const plainText = new TextRenderable(renderer, {
  id: "plain-text",
  content: "Important Message",
  fg: "#FFFF00",
  attributes: TextAttributes.BOLD | TextAttributes.UNDERLINE, // bitwise OR to combine attributes
  position: "absolute",
  left: 5,
  top: 2,
})
``` 

More complex styled text can be created using the `t` template literal:
```typescript
const styledTextRenderable = new TextRenderable(renderer, {
  id: "styled-text",
  content: t`${bold("Important Message")} ${fg("#FF0000")(underline("Important Message"))}`,
  position: "absolute",
  left: 5,
  top: 3,
})
``` 

## Notes
The prompt specifically asked for "4.2 Text Components". While I could not find a section explicitly numbered "4.2", I provided information about "Text Components" from the available documentation, specifically from the React README and the Core Getting Started guide. The `packages/web/src/layouts/Docs.astro` file indicates a documentation structure with a "Components" section that includes a link to `/docs/components/text` , which further supports the existence of a dedicated text component documentation. The `packages/web/src/content/docs/core-concepts/renderables.mdx` file also lists `TextRenderable` as an available renderable.

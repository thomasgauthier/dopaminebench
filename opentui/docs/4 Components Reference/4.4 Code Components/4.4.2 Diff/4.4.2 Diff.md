I cannot provide the full Markdown content for section '4.4.2 Diff' because the provided codebase context does not contain a file or a specific section labeled '4.4.2 Diff' with Markdown content. The `Diff.test.ts` files contain tests for a `DiffRenderable` component, which handles rendering diffs, but they do not contain the Markdown content you are asking for. 

## Notes
The prompt asks for Markdown content from a specific section '4.4.2 Diff'. While there are files related to `Diff` rendering, such as `packages/core/src/renderables/Diff.test.ts` , , and , these files are test files and contain code that tests the rendering of diffs, not the Markdown content of a documentation section. The `Markdown.test.ts` file ,  shows examples of Markdown content being rendered, but none of it corresponds to a section titled '4.4.2 Diff'.

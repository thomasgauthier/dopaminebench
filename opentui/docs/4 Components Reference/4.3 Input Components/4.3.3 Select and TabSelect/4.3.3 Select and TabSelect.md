```markdown
### Select Component

A list selection component.  It has to be focused to receive input.  Default keybindings are `up/k` and `down/j` to navigate the list, `enter` to select. 

```tsx
import type { SelectOption } from "@opentui/core"
import { useState } from "react"

function App() {
  const [selectedIndex, setSelectedIndex] = useState(0)

  const options: SelectOption[] = [
    { name: "Option 1", description: "Option 1 description", value: "opt1" },
    { name: "Option 2", description: "Option 2 description", value: "opt2" },
    { name: "Option 3", description: "Option 3 description", value: "opt3" },
  ]

  return (
    <box style={{ border: true, height: 24 }}>
      <select
        style={{ height: 22 }}
        options={options}
        focused={true}
        onChange={(index, option) => {
          setSelectedIndex(index)
          console.log("Selected:", option)
        }}
      />
    </box>
  )
}
``` 

### TabSelect Component

Horizontal tab-based selection component with descriptions and scroll support.  It has to be focused to receive input.  Default keybindings are `left/[` and `right/]` to navigate the tabs, `enter` to select. 

```typescript
import { TabSelectRenderable, TabSelectRenderableEvents } from "@opentui/core"

const tabs = new TabSelectRenderable(renderer, {
  id: "tabs",
  width: 60,
  options: [
    { name: "Home", description: "Dashboard and overview" },
    { name: "Files", description: "File management" },
    { name: "Settings", description: "Application settings" },
  ],
  tabWidth: 20,
  position: "absolute",
  left: 2,
  top: 1,
})

tabs.on(TabSelectRenderableEvents.ITEM_SELECTED, (index, option) => {
  console.log("Selected:", option.name)
})

tabs.focus()
```

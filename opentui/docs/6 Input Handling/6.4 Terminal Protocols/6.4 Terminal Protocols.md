The user is asking for the content of a specific section, "6.4 Terminal Protocols", which is not present in the provided codebase context. The available wiki page "High-Level Architecture"  contains sections like "6. Terminal Integration"  but not a subsection "6.4 Terminal Protocols".

Therefore, I cannot provide the full Markdown content for section '6.4 Terminal Protocols' as it does not exist in the provided context.

## Notes
The provided context includes a wiki page titled "High-Level Architecture"  which has a section "6. Terminal Integration" . This section discusses terminal capabilities, detection, modes, and environment detection. While related to terminal protocols, it is not explicitly named "6.4 Terminal Protocols" and does not contain a subsection with that exact title.

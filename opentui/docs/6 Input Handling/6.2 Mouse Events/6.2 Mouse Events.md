The user is asking for the content of the "6.2 Mouse Events" section from the documentation. This section describes how mouse interactions are handled in OpenTUI.

## 6.2 Mouse Events

Handle mouse interactions via options: 

```typescript
const button = new BoxRenderable(renderer, {
  id: "button",
  border: true,
  onMouseDown: (event) => {
    console.log("Clicked at", event.x, event.y)
  },
  onMouseOver: (event) => {
    button.borderColor = "#FFFF00"
  },
  onMouseOut: (event) => {
    button.borderColor = "#FFFFFF"
  },
})
``` 

Available mouse events: 

*   `onMouseDown`, `onMouseUp` 
*   `onMouseMove`, `onMouseDrag`, `onMouseDragEnd`, `onMouseDrop` 
*   `onMouseOver`, `onMouseOut` 
*   `onMouseScroll` 
*   `onMouse` (catch-all) 

Mouse events bubble up through the tree.  Stop propagation with `event.stopPropagation()`. 

## Notes

The provided content for "6.2 Mouse Events" is extracted directly from the documentation file `packages/web/src/content/docs/core-concepts/renderables.mdx`. 

The `CliRenderer` class is responsible for input processing, including mouse events, by using `MouseParser` to handle SGR mouse events and dispatching them to the appropriate `Renderable` components.   The `processMouseEvent` method in `Renderable.ts` handles the event dispatching and bubbling.  Testing utilities like `createMockMouse` are available for simulating mouse interactions in tests.

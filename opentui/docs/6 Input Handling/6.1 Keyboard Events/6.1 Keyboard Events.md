It appears you are asking for the content of a specific section, "6.1 Keyboard Events", which is likely part of the documentation for the `opentui` project. Based on the provided context, the `packages/react/README.md` file contains a section on `useKeyboard(handler, options?)` which directly addresses keyboard event handling in the React integration of OpenTUI. 

Here is the Markdown content for the "6.1 Keyboard Events" section, derived from the `useKeyboard` hook documentation:

```markdown
### `useKeyboard(handler, options?)`

Handle keyboard events. 

```tsx
import { useKeyboard } from "@opentui/react"

function App() {
  useKeyboard((key) => {
    if (key.name === "escape") {
      process.exit(0)
    }
  })

  return <text>Press ESC to exit</text>
}
``` 

**Parameters:**

- `handler`: Callback function that receives a `KeyEvent` object 
- `options?`: Optional configuration object: 
  - `release?`: Boolean to include key release events (default: `false`) 

By default, only receives press events (including key repeats with `repeated: true`).  Set `options.release` to `true` to also receive release events. 

**Example with release events:**

```tsx
import { useKeyboard } from "@opentui/react"
import { useState } from "react"

function App() {
  const [pressedKeys, setPressedKeys] = useState<Set<string>>(new Set())

  useKeyboard(
    (event) => {
      setPressedKeys((keys) => {
        const newKeys = new Set(keys)
        if (event.eventType === "release") {
          newKeys.delete(event.name)
        } else {
          newKeys.add(event.name)
        }
        return newKeys
      })
    },
    { release: true },
  )

  return (
    <box>
      <text>Currently pressed: {Array.from(pressedKeys).join(", ") || "none"}</text>
    </box>
  )
}
``` 
```

## Notes

The `useKeyboard` hook in `@opentui/react` provides a way to subscribe to keyboard events within React components.  It leverages an underlying `keyHandler` from the application context, which is an instance of `KeyHandler` from `@opentui/core`.  The `KeyHandler` emits `keypress` and `keyrelease` events.  The `KeyEvent` object passed to the handler contains details about the key pressed, including modifiers like `ctrl`, `meta`, `shift`, and `option`, as well as the `eventType` (press or release).  The `parseKeypress` function is responsible for interpreting raw terminal input sequences, including those from the Kitty keyboard protocol, into `ParsedKey` objects, which are then used to construct `KeyEvent` objects.
